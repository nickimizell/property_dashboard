Fill out the form:
  - Name: ootb-property-db
  - Database: property_dashboard
  - User: property_user
  - Region: Choose closest to you (US East usually fastest)
  - PostgreSQL Version: Leave as default (15)
  - Plan: Free (gives you 500MB storage - perfect for getting started)

  4. Click "Create Database"

  Step 3: Wait for Database Creation

  - Takes about 2-3 minutes to spin up
  - You'll see a loading screen
  - Status will change from "Creating" to "Available"

  Step 4: Get Database Connection Info

  Once it's ready:
  1. Click on your database name in the dashboard
  2. Find the "Connections" section
  3. Copy the "Internal Database URL" - looks like:
  postgresql://property_user:password@dpg-xyz123/property_dashboard

  Step 5: Run Database Migration

  You have a few options to set up the tables:

  Option A: Use a PostgreSQL Client (Recommended)

  1. Download pgAdmin (free): https://www.pgadmin.org/download/
  2. Connect using External Database URL from Render
  3. Copy/paste the contents of database/schema.sql
  4. Execute the script - this creates all tables and sample data

  Option B: Use psql Command Line

  If you have psql installed:
  psql "external-database-url-from-render" < database/schema.sql

  Option C: Render Web Shell (if available)

  Some Render plans include a web-based SQL editor

  Step 6: Verify Database Setup

  After running the migration, you should have:
  - ✅ 5 tables: properties, tasks, contingency_dates, users, activity_log
  - ✅ Sample data: 2 properties and several tasks
  - ✅ Indexes for fast queries
  - ✅ Dashboard stats view

  Step 7: Optional - Deploy API Backend

  If you want team collaboration (multiple users sharing data):

  1. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
  2. Connect repository: nickimizell/property_dashboard
  3. Settings:
    - Name: ootb-property-api
    - Root Directory: server
    - Build Command: npm install
    - Start Command: npm start
  4. Environment Variables:
  NODE_ENV=production
  DATABASE_URL=[paste-your-internal-database-url]
  5. Click "Create Web Service"
