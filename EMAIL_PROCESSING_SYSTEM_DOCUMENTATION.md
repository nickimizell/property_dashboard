## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Document Flow:**
```
Gmail Inbox → IMAP Reader → Grok AI Classification → Property Matching → Document Storage → Auto Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓                ↓
  Unread     Extract Text    Property Related?    Store in DB     Generate Tasks    Email Reply
```

### **Core Components:**

1. **📧 EmailProcessor** (`server/services/emailProcessor.js`)
   - IMAP connection to Gmail
   - Polls every 60 seconds for new emails
   - Marks property-related emails as read, leaves others unread

2. **🤖 GrokClient** (`server/services/grokClient.js`) 
   - Uses Grok API key from environment variable: `GROK_API_KEY`
   - Classifies emails for real estate relevance
   - Extracts property information from documents
   - Generates tasks and calendar events

3. **📄 DocumentExtractor** (`server/services/documentExtractor.js`)
   - Handles PDF, Word, and image text extraction
   - Uses Tesseract.js for OCR on images
   - Stores documents as PostgreSQL Large Objects

4. **🎯 PropertyMatcher** (`server/services/propertyMatcher.js`)
   - Matches emails to existing properties by address, MLS, client name
   - Fuzzy matching with confidence scoring
   - Falls back to manual review for low confidence matches

5. **📤 EmailResponder** (`server/services/emailResponder.js`)
   - Sends intelligent automated responses
   - Uses existing Gmail SMTP: `transaction.coordinator.agent@gmail.com`
   - Professional HTML templates with action summaries

6. **🎼 EmailProcessingOrchestrator** (`server/services/emailProcessingOrchestrator.js`)
   - Coordinates all services into complete workflow
   - Handles error recovery and logging
   - Provides statistics and monitoring

## 📊 **Email Processing Workflow**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **📬 Email Receipt**
   - IMAP polls Gmail every 60 seconds
   - Fetches unread emails with attachments

2. **🤖 AI Classification**
   - Grok analyzes email content and attachments
   - Determines real estate relevance with confidence score

3. **✅ Email Marking**
   - Property-related emails: Marked as read
   - Non-property emails: Left unread (ignored)

4. **📄 Document Processing**
   - Extract text from PDF, Word, and image attachments
   - OCR processing for scanned documents
   - Store as PostgreSQL Large Objects

5. **🎯 Property Matching**
   - Match to existing properties by multiple methods
   - Confidence scoring with manual review for low matches

6. **💾 Data Storage**
   - Store documents with extracted text
   - Create/update transaction document records
   - Add notes to property records

7. **📋 Task Generation**
   - AI generates relevant tasks based on document content
   - Creates calendar events for important dates
   - Updates transaction timeline

8. **📤 Auto Response**
   - Sends intelligent email responses
   - Summarizes actions taken
   - Provides dashboard links

---

## 📈 **Monitoring & Statistics**

### **Real-Time Stats Available:**
- Emails processed
- Property matches found
- Documents stored
- Tasks created
- Calendar events generated
- Response emails sent
- Processing errors

### **Dashboard Views:**
- Email processing queue
- Document storage status
- Property matching accuracy
- System performance metrics

---

## 🔍 **Property Matching Logic**

### **Matching Methods (by priority):**

1. **MLS Number** (99% confidence)
   - Searches property notes and fields for MLS references

2. **Loan Number** (95% confidence) 
   - Exact match with `properties.loan_number` field

3. **Exact Address** (95% confidence)
   - Normalized address comparison

4. **Client Name** (90% exact, 70% partial)
   - Matches against `properties.client_name` field

5. **Fuzzy Address** (60% confidence)
   - PostgreSQL similarity matching

6. **Combined Indicators** (80% confidence)
   - Multiple weak signals (agent name + partial address)

### **Manual Review Triggers:**
- Confidence below 75%
- Property-related but no identifying information
- Multiple possible matches

## 📧 **Email Response System**

### **Response Types:**

#### **Property Matched - Actions Taken:**
```
✅ Documents Received - 123 Main St
Your documents have been successfully received and saved.

Documents saved:
📄 Purchase_Agreement.pdf (contract)
📄 Inspection_Report.pdf (inspection)

**Additional Actions:**
✅ 3 tasks created and assigned
✅ 2 calendar events scheduled
✅ 1 note added to property record

View property: [Dashboard Link]
```

#### **Property Not Found:**
```
⚠️ Property Not Found - Action Required

Please add the property to our dashboard or contact your agent.
Dashboard: [Link]
```

### **Template System:**
- Configurable HTML email templates
- Variable substitution
- Professional branding
- Mobile-responsive design

---

## 🛡️ **Security & Compliance**

### **Data Protection:**
- All documents stored in PostgreSQL with encryption
- SHA-256 file hashing for deduplication
- Audit trail for all processing activities
- Role-based access control (Admin, Agent, Viewer)

### **Email Security:**
- Gmail App Passwords (not regular passwords)
- TLS/SSL encryption for all connections
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Error handling and graceful failures

---

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Test Email Setup:**
1. Send test emails to `transaction.coordinator.agent@gmail.com`
2. Include property address in subject or body
3. Attach PDF, Word, or image documents
4. Monitor processing via dashboard

### **Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ Purchase agreements with property addresses
- ✅ Inspection reports with multiple attachments
- ✅ Emails without property information (should be ignored)
- ✅ Scanned documents requiring OCR
- ✅ Multiple properties in single email

## 📝 **Notes for Next Developer**

### **Architecture Decisions Made:**
1. **No zipForms Integration** - Removed entirely, zipForms is external form creation tool
2. **Email-Centric Design** - System receives completed documents via email
3. **PostgreSQL Storage** - Documents stored as Large Objects within 15GB limit
4. **Grok AI Integration** - Uses existing API key, proven working
5. **Gmail Integration** - Uses existing email account and app password

### **Future DocuSign Integration Notes:**
- Plan to add DocuSign amendment routing
- Current system detects document types - can identify amendments
- API structure ready for DocuSign webhook integration
- Amendment routing would be triggered after document analysis

### **Performance Considerations:**
- System processes 20 emails per batch maximum
- OCR processing can be CPU intensive for large images
- PostgreSQL Large Objects efficient for document storage
- Grok API rate limited to 5 calls per minute

### **Extension Points:**
- Additional document extractors can be added to DocumentExtractor
- New property matching strategies can be added to PropertyMatcher
- Email response templates are fully configurable
- API endpoints can be extended for additional functionality
